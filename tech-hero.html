            Kimberly Bryant is a technologist and activist best known as the founder of
            Black Girls Code, a nonprofit organization dedicated to teaching coding and
            computer science skills to young Black girls. After working in biotechnology
            and engineering, Bryant recognized the lack of diversity in tech and decided
            to create pathways for students who are often excluded from these spaces.

        <p>
            Through workshops, summer camps, and community programs, Black Girls Code
            empowers students with both technical skills and confidence. Bryant’s work
            challenges systemic barriers related to race and gender while addressing
            implicit bias in education and hiring practices.

            Her leadership demonstrates how technology can be used as a tool for social
            change, not just innovation. Rather than focusing on profit or prestige,
            Bryant centers access, representation, and long-term impact—making her an
            important figure in the movement toward equity in tech.
